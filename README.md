This Git Repo contains the sample app from the AngularJS Mobile Pack for PHP modified to display Cases.
After downloading the Mobile Pack and getting the sample app up and running,
I followed the step-by-step instructions published by Reid Carlberg (http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/04/fast-easy-mobile-web-apps-with-angularjs.html)
on how to add the Account object to the mobile app. However, instead of adding the Account object 
(it was already in the sample app), I followed the steps for Case.  I deployed the PHP app to Heroku and it works like
a champ.  Here are some resources that I found helpful in getting up to speed on Angular JS:
